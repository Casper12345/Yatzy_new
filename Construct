game = Game()
game.start()

    def __init__(self):
        self.scoreboard = ScoreBoard()

    def start_game:
        self.current_round = Round(self.scoreboard)
        result = self.current_round.begin()

        win_condition = ScoreBoardAnalyzer()

        while not win_condition.is_won():
            self.current_round = Round(self.scoreboard)


The way of constructing this game is following the control, view, module model.
Trying to implement a OOP design.
